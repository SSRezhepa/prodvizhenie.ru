Autoptimize speeds up your website and helps you save bandwidth by aggregating and minimizing JS and CSS.

== Description ==

Autoptimize makes optimizing your site really easy. It concatenates all scripts and styles, minifies and compresses them, adds expires headers, caches them, and moves styles to the page head, and scripts to the footer. It also minifies the HTML code itself, making your page really lightweight.

If you consider performance important, we recommend the use of a caching-plugin such as e.g. [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/) or 
[HyperCache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `autoptimize` folder to  to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Settings -> Autoptimize` and enable the options you want. Generally this means "Optimize HTML/CSS/JavaScript", but if you experience problems you might want to disable some.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the plugin do to help speed up my site? =

It concatenates all scripts and styles, minifies and compresses them, adds expires headers, caches them, and moves styles to the page head, and scripts to the footer. It also minifies the HTML code itself, making your page really lightweight.

= Will this work with my blog? =

Yes, most of the time, but there will always be exceptions. Although Autoptimize goes through great lengths to work with as many themes and plugins possible, there undoubtably are circumstances in which Autoptimize will not work to the full extent (full HTML, JS and CSS optimization). See "Troubleshooting" below for info on how to proceed if you encounter issues.

= Does Autoptimize work with BuddyPress? =

Based on feedback received from BuddyPress users, CSS and JS-Autoptimization do not seem to work correctly, leaving you with only HTML optimizations. I will look into this in the future and am happy to take hints or code-improvements the help with BuddyPress compatibility in the mean time.

= Compatibility with WP SlimSat =

There have been reports of sightings of javascript errors when using Autoptimize together with WP SlimStat. Both [Camu (WP SlimStat developer)](http://profiles.wordpress.org/coolmann/) and I have installed both plugins on test-environments and [found no proof of such incompatibility](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/dropdown-menus-dont-work-when-slimstat-is-enabled?replies=14#post-4086894). Our common conclusion is that there are rare cases in which yet another theme or plugin's JavaScript are triggering these errors. If you do encounter JavaScript-errors when you have both WP SlimStat and Autoptimize installed, add "SlimStatParams, wp-slimstat.js" in the "Exclude scripts from autoptimize:" option on the admin-page and all should be well.

= Why are some options marked as Deprecated? =
YUI compression and the CDN options are marked as deprecated to indicate that this functionality will be removed for the next major version (probably 1.7.0). YUI compression was pretty exotic and required one to install JAVA and the YUI compression software. CDN options are deprecated as well; CDN isn't core functionality and can better be accomplished using e.g. [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/) (which is a must-have companion of Autoptimize anyhow).

= Configuring & Troubleshooting Autoptimize =

After having installed and activated the plugin, you'll have access to an admin page where you can to enable HTML, CSS and JavaScript optimization. According to your liking, you can start of just enabling all of them, or if you're more cautious one at a time.

If your blog doens't function normally after having turned on Autoptimize, here are some pointers to identify & solve such issues:
* In case your blog looks weird, i.e. when the layout gets messed up, there is problem with CSS optimization. In this case you can turn on the option "Look for styles on just head?" and see if that solves the problem. You can also force CSS not to be aggregated by wrapping it in noptimize-tags in your theme or widget.
* In case some functionality on your site stops working (a carroussel, a menu, the search input, ...) you're likely hitting JavaScript optimization trouble. Enable the option "Look for scripts only in head?" and/or "Force JavaScript in <head>?" and try again. Alternatively -for the technically savvy- you can exclude specific scripts from being treated (moved and/ or aggregated) by Autoptimize by adding a string that will match the offending Javascript or excluding it from within your template files or widgets by wrapping the code between noptimize-tags. Identifying the offending JavaScript and choosing the correct exclusion-string can be trial and error, but in the majority of cases JavaScript optimization issues can be solved this way.
* If you can't get either CSS or JS optimization working, you can off course always continue using the other two optimization-techniques.
* If you tried the troubleshooting tips above and you still can't get CSS and JS working at all, you can ask for support on the [WordPress Autoptimize support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autoptimize). See below for a description of what information you should provide in your "trouble ticket"

= How can I exclude some CSS/JS/HTML from being autoptimized? =
Starting with version 1.6.6 Autoptimize excludes everything inside noptimize tags, e.g.:
`<!--noptimize--><script>alert('this will not get autoptimized');</script><!--/noptimize-->`

You can do this in your page/ post content, in widgets and in your theme files (consider creating [a child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) to avoid your work being overwritten by theme updates).

= Where can I report an error? =

You can report problems on the [wordpress.org support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autoptimize), or [contact the maintainer using this contact form](http://blog.futtta.be/contact/).

= What information should I include when requesting support =

* A description of the problem, including screenshots and information from your browser's Error/ debug console
* URL of your blog (you can turn Autoptimize off, but should be willing to turn it briefly on to have the error visible)
* your Autoptimize settings (including a description of changes you made to the configuration to try to troubleshoot yourself)
* the Theme used (including the Theme's download link)
* optionally plugins used (if you suspect one or more plugins are raising havoc)

== Changelog ==
